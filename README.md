# firstProject
The first ever C# program I was actually proud of.

The problem description are as follows: 

Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the first name, whose sum of characters is equal
to or larger than a given number N, which will be given on the first line. Use a function that accepts another
function as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program.
Something along the lines of Func&lt;string, int, bool&gt;. Afterwards create your main function which should
accept the first function as one of its parameters.
